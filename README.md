# Sprinkler_Project
18 zone sprinkler control with ESPhome and Home Assistant

This project uses an ESP32-Wrover Board that controls 3 banks of relays for Main valves and Zone valves.
Included in the project are the ESP32 YAML code, pt. to pt. wiring diagrams, Home Assistant Lovelace YAML, 
and additions to the HA sensors.yaml, binary_sensor.yaml, and configuration.yaml files

The files will need to be tweaked to support your entity naming and such.

The HA Lovelace code will also need to be edited to match the entity names to match your HA entity assignments.
